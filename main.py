    @brief    :  Hydropulse is a Python-based application designed to simulate a dynamic grid of
                 interactive elements, akin to a water ripple effect. Primarily developed using
                 Pyglet and math libraries, it offers users a visually engaging experience through
                 smooth animations and responsive interactions.

    @features :  > Grid Simulation: Creates a dynamic grid of interactive elements.
                 > Mouse Interaction: Reacts to real-time mouse movements and clicks.
                 > Ripple Effect: Initiates ripple effects from selected elements.
                 > Interpolation: Ensures smooth transitions and visual effects.
                 > Platform Compatibility: Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
